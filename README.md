# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

#### The school district encountered evidences of academic dishonesty in the scores of Reading and Math tests of the nine graders from Thomas High School. 
#### In this sense, it was requested the altered scores to be replaced by Nan and to perform a revised school district analysis.  Additionally, some insights about how these changes impacted the original overall analysis has been also requested.

# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

### Evidences of academic dishonesty were found in the scores of reading and math tests of the nine graders from Thomas High School. 
### The school district requested all these altered scores to be replaced with NaNs and that the School District Report is recreated. An analysis about how these changes impacted the original overall analysis has to be performed too.

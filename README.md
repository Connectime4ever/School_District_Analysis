# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

### After a School District Report was finished, evidences of academic dishonesty were found in the scores of reading and math tests of the nine graders from Thomas High School. 
### The school district requested all these altered scores to be replaced with NaNs and that the School District Report is recreated. An analysis about how these changes impacted the original overall analysis has to be performed too.

## Results

+ The revised District Summary shows a slight different vs. the former one. The changes performed in the 9th grader Math and Reading scores did not have a noticeble impact on this report. Please find below the above mentioned reports as reference. 

+ The revised School Summary substantially differs from the original report as a result of Thomas High Schools 9th graders' scores replaced by NaN.   
    + Thomas High School shows a relevant improvement in its Math, Reading and Overall Passing Percentage.
    + On the other side, the school also improved its position compared to other schools, ranking in the top place. All in all showing a relatively "better" performance.
